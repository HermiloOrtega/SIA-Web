# 🌐 SIA Web

## 🧭 Overview
**SIA Web** is a planned web-based extension of the SIA (Sistema Integral de Abastecimientos) platform at AHMSA. The goal of this system was to centralize multiple procurement and material management modules under one scalable, modern, and accessible platform using web technologies.

While the original SIA was a Windows Forms application, **SIA Web** was designed to be its cross-platform successor, ensuring users could interact with procurement tools from any device or location securely.

## 💡 Idea & Concept
SIA Web was envisioned to:
- Unify various departmental workflows (Purchasing, Warehouse, Projects)
- Enable real-time access to purchase approvals, petty cash requests, material tests
- Offer dashboards, alerts, and KPIs to decision-makers
- Reduce reliance on desktop-bound systems and encourage mobility

## ✨ Features & Functionality (Planned or Proposed)
- 🧾 Purchase Request Management (incl. petty cash & materials)
- 🔎 Vendor and product database search
- 📥 Digital document uploads (quotes, invoices, evidence)
- 💬 Notifications and reminders
- 🧩 Module Integration: Petty Cash, Material Testing, Contracts, Estimations
- 📊 Dashboard for KPIs and workflow summaries
- 🌐 Multi-role login with permissions per department
